# Impact-of-AI-on-Technical-Writing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed the whole scenario in technology based industries. The impact of AI is vast from automation of car that is unmanned vehicle to aerospace industry.

Technical documentation is no exception, with the help of AI, the old methodology of creating user manual and writing documents has transformed.

Normally writing the technical user maual or guide needs deep research and lot of efforts to make the content short, clear, unambiguous and relevant. 

But the introcuction of AI technology in technical writing has made the job of a technical writer much more easier and saves the time and effort of the writer.

AI tools creates the output without human intelligence based on the input data.

On the contrary, user manual or user guide content needs human touch to make the content more interesting for the audiance or end user.

Here the actual problem lies with AI technology, AI generated content maybe boring for the audiance then audiance will automatically loose interest for the product.

Using AI technology grammer and spelling check, editing, creating of bullet points became easy and technical writers can save their time. This has made their work easy and quick.

Introduction of AI technology has made the technical writing proccess much faster and in this time technical writer can focus more on the other parts e.g. gathering data and analysis.

It is true that AI tool has transformed the field of technical documentation inspte of that it has some challanges.

Teachnical writers can't alawys rely on the data given by AI tool. Because AI gives the output based on the data AI tool has proccessed as input. The input data maybe not accurate then the output given by the AI tool would be totally wrong. So technical writers should not totally fall for the AI proccessed content, which can be false content and it can mislead the audiance.

More over there is alawys a privacy concern on using AI tool.

Technical writer should alawys crosscheck the content proccessed by AI and give human touch and empathy to the content which AI lacks to give. So that reader find the content more interesting.
